Letter Recognition with MFCC Feature Extraction
Speech Recognition
Voice or speaker recognition is the ability of a machine or program to receive and interpret
dictation or to understand and carry out spoken commands.
Voice or speaker recognition software on computers requires that analog audio be
converted into digital signals, known as analog-to-digital conversion. For a computer to
decipher a signal, it must have a digital database, or vocabulary, of words or syllables, as
well as a speedy means for comparing this data to signals. The speech patterns are stored
on the hard drive and loaded into memory when the program is run. A comparator checks
these stored patterns against the output of the A/D converter this is an action called pattern
recognition.
Some speech recognition systems require "training" (also called "enrollment") where an
individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes
the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech,
resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called "speaker
independent” systems. Systems that use training are called "speaker dependent” systems
